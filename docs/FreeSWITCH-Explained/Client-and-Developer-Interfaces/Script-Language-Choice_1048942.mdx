## About

\[ NOTE: This page was copied whole from the old mediawiki is very old by now. To paraphrase Wikipedia, it has many problems, not the least of which is objectivity. Lua solves some problems, perl solves others, and so on. Use the best tool for the job. \]  

The short answer: [Lua](../Modules/mod_lua_1048944.mdx).

The more in depth answer: Use what works for you, but be aware of the limitations.

[JavaScript](JavaScript/index.mdx#api) is very popular but that doesn't make it a great choice for embedded telephony programming. It is much heavier than Lua and it uses a completely different interface method to FreeSWITCH.

[Python](../Modules/mod_python_1048940.mdx#eol) is very popular but that doesn't make it a great choice for embedded telephony programming. It does not embed nicely like Lua does. Furthermore, most of the FreeSWITCH developers are Perl fans. :)

[Perl](../Modules/mod_perl_1048930.mdx#about) is still popular and it is a decent choice for embedded telephony programming. However, Lua is still lighter than Perl for this sort of thing and doesn't lack any features that Perl has, including regular expressions.

Bottom line: there's just no reason not to use Lua.

## Performance

It may matter, so let's compare:

Lua vs. Javascript: Script with MySQL database lookup, some simple logical decisions, creation of channel variables.

For what it is worth, Lua was **50% faster** than Javascript.
