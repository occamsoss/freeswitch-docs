# FreeSWITCH Docs Legacy Context Review

## About

As FreeSWITCH has evolved, so has its documentation. The collective knowledge of the community has
transitioned through various platforms and phases. This review focuses on legacy comments and content 
that originated from our migration from a Confluence wiki to Docusaurus.

### Goals

This document aims to streamline documentation content while preserving valuable historical information.

> I think the title is appropriate because the flow chart does shows the life cycles of both legs of a call, from start to finish, which is basically a call. In CS_NEW, the A leg channel is created, and in CS_EXECUTE (depending on the dialplan instructions) a B leg channel will also be created. Could be wrong.

> When you see different values when you run show calls and show channels from the CLI, it is because show calls only counts bridged calls
>
> Not quite true. A call that is ringing shows up multiple times in "show calls", once for the inbound channel and once each for all the outbound channels.

Maybe future releases won't require this but I'm writing here so at least I know how to resolve tfs_cli connection issues.

> You more than likely don't need them when talking to FreeSWITCH on the public internet. TURN will gain you very little unless you're doing peer to peer media and need to hairpin thru a TURN server.

> tl;dr: lua INITIATION time is about 60ms, mod\_v8 init is about 80ms. I didn't benchmark running the scripts, I expect the main issue is from the init delay. On a test on FreeSWITCH (Version 1.4.15 -1 64bit) I got these results:I created a hello.lua file with: freeswitch.consoleLog("WARNING", "Ho!\\n")and also hello.js with: console\_log("WARNING", "Ho!\\n"); Then I ran in fs\_cli and compared the time stamps:log debug about to init lualuarun hello.lualog debug about to init jsjsrun hello.js(make sure to include an enter when you paste so it runs right away.) I did a 3-4 tests with each, and they are relatively consistent: .06 seconds for lua to print it's debug statement and .08 seconds for javascript. So I don't think you should be overly concerned about using javascript instead of lua.

> what about golang? erlang? java?And need compare not simple console\_log but heavy and/or long operations, ie work with radius, mysql. Lua too much stupid, even "filesize" - need custom funcs.And what about many calls and python GIL?
